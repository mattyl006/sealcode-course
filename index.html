            In the vast landscape of modern technology, where innovation drives progress, one concept stands out as
            both
            a
            promise and a challenge: quantum computing. This enigmatic field, built upon the principles of quantum
            mechanics, has captured the imagination of scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts alike, offering a
            glimpse
            into
            a realm where computational power transcends the boundaries of classical computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, quantum computing harnesses the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics to perform
            complex
            calculations at an unprecedented scale. Unlike classical computers, which rely on bits to represent
            information
            in binary form (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in
            multiple
            states simultaneously due to the phenomena of superposition and entanglement.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Qubits:</strong> The building blocks of quantum computation, qubits exist in a state of
                superposition, allowing them to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This duality forms the
                foundation for parallel processing and exponential increases in computational power.

            <li>
                <strong>Quantum Supremacy:</strong> A milestone in the development of quantum computing, quantum
                supremacy refers to the demonstration of a quantum computer outperforming the most powerful
                classical supercomputers in specific tasks. Google's achievement of quantum supremacy in 2019 marked
                a significant advancement in the field.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> From cryptography and optimization to drug discovery and materials
                science, the potential applications of quantum computing span a diverse array of fields. Quantum
                computers hold the promise of revolutionizing industries and addressing some of the most pressing
